# Static Batching Sorting Fix

[Apkd's fix](https://github.com/apkd/UnityStaticBatchingSortingPatch) for Unity's ludicrously terrible "sorting" for static batches, bundled into a UPM package and modified to work with the VRChat SDK (the SDK currently has a dll with an identical name to one in Unity Collections, this breaks everything).
